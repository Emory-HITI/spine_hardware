# Automatic Localization and Brand Detection of Cervical Spine Hardware
This repository contains the code for the paper titled: <b>"Automatic localization and brand detection of cervical spine hardware on radiography using weakly supervised machine learning"</b>

## Repository Structure
- `object_localization_model`: Contains the code and model weights for the object localization model. The weights can be unzipped and loaded using TensorFlow
- `brand_prediction_model`: Contains the code and model weights for the brand identification model. The weights should be unzipped and loaded using `torch.load` function from PyTorch

## Questions/Concerns
Please feel free to reach out to [Raman Dutt](https://github.com/Raman1121) or [Dylan Mendonca](https://github.com/mdylan2) if you have any questions on the implementations within this repository
